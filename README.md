# Udacity-Project---Exploring-Weather-Trends
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 01 - Exploring Weather Trends using Python and SQL

## Description

### Goals:

Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

- create a visualization
- prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live

### Steps:

1. Extract the data from the database
    * Using SQL
2. Extract CSV file for use in line chart
    * Drawn with Matplotlib in Python
3. Use said chart to make observations

### Submission:

The final analysis will take the form of a PDF document which contains a plot of the data, analysis of said plot and outlines the steps taken:

* What tools were used for each step
* How calculations were perfomed
* Key considerations when analyzing the trends

All code used will be placed in this repository for inspection.
