Next, we'll want to calculate the moving averages before doing the final plot

In my project submission I chose a moving average of 7 but this did not give a
smooth curve that was expected according to my feedback and I need to chose a
larger range. Given that the data spans around 200 years I'll want to
investigate 10 years and 100 years and maybe sharpen things from there
